        <h2>English Phrasal Verb in Use Advanced - Micahel MCarthy Felicity O'Dell </h2>
        <div class="a"><p>Susan Cameron goes to great lengths to explain in a simple way the basics of English pronunciation. The book covers the vowels, consonants and accents necessary for proper pronunciation, which facilitates communication. Each section has an introduction, examples and exercises. In addition, the book offers access to instructional videos and audio, both of which can be downloaded from the website and replayed as many times as needed. For beginners in the English language this book is highly recommended.  </p></div>
    <!-- <p>This is the secon book of Cambridge dedicated to Phrasal Verb for Advanced. </p> -->

        <h2>English Phrasal Verb in Use Advanced - Micahel MCarthy Felicity O'Dell </h2>
        <div class="a"><p>Longman publishers offer us in this edition a large collection of verb phrases. A verb phrase is a construction containing a verb associated with another linguistic element to complete its meaning. The book offers 5,000 verb phrases. The format of the book is simple and easy to understand. It has a table of contents with the most common verb and verb constructions. The book is recommended for intermediate learners who need to add vocabulary and naturalization to their verbal expression.  </p></div>

        <h2>English Phrasal Verb in Use Advanced - Micahel MCarthy Felicity O'Dell </h2>
        <div class="a"><p>Rebecca M. Dauer offers a detailed version of the English pronunciation. Focusing on the specifics of American English, Dauer uses the IPA system to explain the pronunciation of vowels, consonants and the linguistic stresses necessary for proper pronunciation. The book has a number of examples and exercises which will allow the student to understand and practice their pronunciation. Unfortunately, the book is recommended for intermediate and advanced students due to the heavy use of technical language.  </p></div>

        <h2>English Phrasal Verb in Use Advanced - Micahel MCarthy Felicity O'Dell </h2>
         <div class="a"><p>Mark Davies and Dee Gardener have an interesting proposal for the student interested in learning English. These authors offer us a dictionary of frequency, that is to say, they provide us with the most used words in the English language. The great advantage of this type of book is that the student has the opportunity to access the most used words and practice their pronunciation and grammar. This saves long hours of study of words that will never be used as brodinagin.  </p></div>

In a simple way the book presents the conjugation of these verbs. The book has the conjugations of the verbs, examples and for the benefit of beginner students it offers a list of the 55 most used verbs. In addition the book offers a list of verb phrases.   </p></div>
